    "description": "Door-2-Door is a field operations console built for fiber deployment teams. It helps crews coordinate door-to-door canvassing, record every household contact attempt, and synchronize updates with downstream systems. The app combines a map-driven view of neighborhoods, detailed per-house records, and real-time shift tracking so that field teams and administrators can keep deployment programs on schedule. In practice, Door-2-Door serves everyone from front-line field agents (logging visits) to dispatchers (monitoring progress) and administrators (ensuring data quality across organizations).",
