    <h1>Setting Up a Static Blog with Next.js</h1>
    
    <p>Creating a blog section for your Next.js portfolio can be done in several ways. Today, I'll show you how to set up a static blog that serves HTML files directly, which is perfect for content that doesn't change frequently.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Static HTML Files?</h2>
    
    <p>There are several advantages to using static HTML files for your blog:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> HTML files load faster than dynamically generated content</li>
        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> No need for a CMS or database</li>
        <li><strong>SEO-friendly:</strong> Search engines can easily crawl static content</li>
        <li><strong>Version control:</strong> Your content is stored in your repository</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> You can write in any format and convert to HTML</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Implementation Strategy</h2>
    
    <p>The approach I've implemented uses:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>HTML files stored in <code>public/blog/posts/</code></li>
        <li>Next.js API routes to read and serve the content</li>
        <li>Dynamic pages for blog listing and individual posts</li>
        <li>Metadata extraction from HTML for SEO</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    
    <p>This setup includes:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Automatic metadata extraction from HTML titles and content</li>
        <li>Responsive design that matches your portfolio theme</li>
        <li>SEO optimization with proper meta tags</li>
        <li>Clean URLs without file extensions</li>
        <li>Integration with your existing internationalization setup</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    
    <p>Now that the blog is set up, you can:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Add new HTML files to the posts directory</li>
        <li>Customize the styling to match your brand</li>
        <li>Add features like search, categories, or tags</li>
        <li>Implement an RSS feed for subscribers</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This approach gives you the best of both worlds: the performance of static content with the flexibility of a dynamic framework.</p>
