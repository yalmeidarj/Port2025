    <h1>Web Development Trends to Watch in 2025</h1>
    
    <p>As we move into 2025, the web development landscape continues to evolve rapidly. Here are the key trends that developers should keep an eye on this year.</p>
    
    <h2>1. AI-Powered Development Tools</h2>
    
    <p>Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing how we write code. From GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, AI assistants are becoming indispensable tools for developers. Expect to see more sophisticated AI tools that can help with debugging, code optimization, and even architecture decisions.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Edge Computing and Edge Functions</h2>
    
    <p>Edge computing is bringing computation closer to users, reducing latency and improving performance. Platforms like Vercel Edge Functions, Cloudflare Workers, and AWS Lambda@Edge are making it easier to deploy code at the edge.</p>
    
    <h2>3. WebAssembly (WASM) Adoption</h2>
    
    <p>WebAssembly is gaining traction for performance-critical applications. We're seeing more use cases beyond just games and graphics, including data processing, machine learning, and even entire applications running in the browser.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) Evolution</h2>
    
    <p>PWAs are becoming more sophisticated with better offline capabilities, push notifications, and native-like experiences. The gap between web and native apps continues to narrow.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Micro-Frontends Architecture</h2>
    
    <p>Large organizations are adopting micro-frontends to scale their frontend development. This approach allows teams to work independently on different parts of the application while maintaining consistency.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Renaissance</h2>
    
    <p>With frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, and SvelteKit, SSR is making a comeback. The focus is on providing better SEO, faster initial page loads, and improved user experience.</p>
    
    <h2>7. CSS-in-JS Evolution</h2>
    
    <p>CSS-in-JS solutions are becoming more performant and feature-rich. We're seeing better TypeScript support, zero-runtime solutions, and improved developer experience.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p>These trends reflect the industry's focus on performance, developer experience, and user satisfaction. As developers, it's important to stay updated with these changes while also maintaining a solid foundation in core web technologies.</p>
